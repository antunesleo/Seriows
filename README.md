# Seriows
Seriows are a concept of mobile application for series lovers. This repo contains just the home, list series and serie info screen.
This project was developed just in 6 hours by me, Guilherme Lima, Mauro Dragoni Junior, Edson Kishimoto, Carlos Magno and Thiago Pivetta in a beaultiful sunday.  
We used a hardcoded json file to populate the series screen. The app also save the json info in a SQLite database.
